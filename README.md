# Maintenance Counter

Simple single page web-app to track the progress of necessary maintenance tasks for vehicles. Once the maintenance interval is reached it emerges. The maintenance task can be marked as done an the interval progress will be set to zero.

An arbitrary number of intervals can be added. The intervals can be activated / deactivated to allow to change the progress of several intervals.

There is currently no server connection so the intervals progress will be saved in the LocalStorage of the browser.

The web app was built with react and uses FontAwesome-Icons. Some of the animations uses the framer-motion library.
